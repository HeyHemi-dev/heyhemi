## Wedding Ready MVP - Founder/Software Developer

Created, designed, and developing Wedding Ready; a Pinterest-inspired wedding planning platform.

## **Full-Stack Development & Architecture:**

- **Modern Full-Stack Frameworks:** Proficiently utilized **Next.js (App Router)** for building a server-rendered React application, effectively leveraging its core features like Server Components, Suspense Loading States, Client Components, Route Handlers, and Server Actions.
- **Server/Client Component Architecture:** Demonstrated a clear understanding of React's Server and Client Component paradigms, strategically choosing the appropriate component type for optimal performance and data fetching patterns.
- **Server Actions:** Implemented **Next.js Server Actions** for handling form submissions and server-side mutations directly, simplifying data flow and reducing the need for explicit API endpoints.
- **API Route Handling:** Developed API routes using **Next.js Route Handlers** for specific backend tasks like file uploads.
- **Database Design & ORM:** Designed database schemas (db/schema.ts) and interacted with a **PostgreSQL** database (via **Supabase**) using the **Drizzle ORM**, including defining relations, seeding data, and writing type-safe queries.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Implemented user authentication and authorization logic, likely integrating **Supabase Auth**, with helper functions and middleware.

## **Frontend Development:**

- **Client-Side State Management & Caching:** Leveraged **TanStack Query (React Query)** for efficient client-side data fetching, caching, background synchronization, and managing mutation states (loading, error, success), including **optimistic updates** for improved UX.
- **Form Handling & Validation:** Implemented robust forms using **React Hook Form** and **Zod** for client-side and server-side validation, coupled with Server Actions for submission.
- **File Uploads:** Integrated **UploadThing** for handling file uploads, including creating a custom client-side dropzone component and server-side processing.
- **UI Development with Component Libraries:** Built user interfaces using **Shadcn UI** components and **Tailwind CSS** for styling, adhering to a design system and utility-first principles.

## **Backend Development & DevOps:**

- **Database Management:** Experience with database setup, schema definition, migrations, and seeding in a PostgreSQL environment.
- **Serverless Functions/Edge Functions:** Experience deploying and managing backend logic within a serverless architecture.
- CI/CD

## **Software Engineering Practices:**

- **Agile Development:** Implemented project planning and management through Linear, following self-imposed development cycles and sprints. Defined MVP scope to maintain focus and prevent feature-creep while ensuring delivery of core functionality.
- **Performance Optimization:** Demonstrated awareness of performance considerations through choices like Server Components, efficient data fetching patterns (React Query caching, selective mutations).
- **Clean Code & Layered Architecture:** Adherence to clean code principles (meaningful names, single responsibility, DRY) defined boundaries between presentation, logic and data layers.
- **TypeScript Expertise:** Implemented a strongly-typed codebase using **TypeScript**, including custom type definitions, enums, generic utilities, and adherence to strict typing rules for enhanced code safety and maintainability.
- **Code Organization:** Maintained a well-structured codebase following established conventions (e.g., folder structure, kebab-case naming).
- **Version Control:** Use of Git for version control (standard practice).

## **Business Development:**

- **Market Research & Customer Understanding:** Conducted extensive customer research through user stories, interviews, and journey mapping to identify key pain points in the wedding planning process, documented through detailed customer stories.
- **Business Model & Revenue Strategy:** Created a comprehensive Lean Canvas business model with multiple revenue streams, including promoted pins, regional visibility expansion, and premium vendor features, while defining clear value propositions and market segments.
- **Market Strategy & Implementation:** Developed a focused MVP strategy for the New Zealand wedding market, leveraging 13 years of industry relationships, with a multi-channel marketing approach through social media, vendor partnerships, and wedding expos.
- **Pitch Development:** Created compelling presentation materials explaining the business concept, market opportunity, and competitive advantage.
- **UI/UX Design & Branding:** Created comprehensive design mockups in Figma, implementing a cohesive brand identity with custom color palette and typography system, designing user-friendly interfaces that follow WCAG accessibility guidelines, and establishing clear visual hierarchy through consistent component design.
